    <h1>To appreciate each other's existence</h1>
    <p>In the real world, if you happen to see me, you will find a somewhat aloof young man with a slightly hunched back (common computer users L). His mind just went through a radical change, and he now appreciate the company of others much more than he used to...</p>
    <p>My name is Bach. In Vietnamese, it means <strong>100</strong> (the number, yes), and in German (why also yes) it depicts a small stream of water. But I usually ask others to call me Buck, which in my mental representation usually includes one dollar and the operator Buck from the shooting video game Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
    <p>So, what did I learn from my two years of studying abroad from the MA program in Hungary? Quite a lot, for my own personal growth. Not much, for the "career-oriented" future that society demands.</p>

    <br>
    <p>But I will list a couple of things that I deem to be the most important and life-chaning during my time there</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The world is far more complex than I originally perceive it to be. Progress in economics and technological evolution does not mean all misery on earth will magically disappear one day.</li>
        <li>Meaningful relationships are far more important than fleeing attachment to short-lived objects and video games that I could buy online.</li>
        <li>Loneliness eats you alive from inside out. I made the mistake of thinking one man can find solace and pleasure in the digital fantasy, but social interactions in real life are much more valuable to my mental wellbeing.</li>
        <li>The friends I made from afar... I long to see them again already. Some came from war-torn regions, some came from third-world countries. But everyone was there, at that point in time, to seek a better future, for themselves, and the society.</li>
        <li>The shared truth and reality can unite people across boundaries and cultures.</li>
    </ol>
